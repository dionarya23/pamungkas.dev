## Getting Started with Svelte

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks like React and Vue, Svelte shifts much of the work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

## Why Svelte?

1. **No Virtual DOM**: Svelte compiles your code to efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.
2. **Less Code**: Svelte components require significantly less boilerplate than equivalent components written in other frameworks.
3. **Truly Reactive**: Svelte makes reactivity a first-class citizen of the language.

## Getting Started

To create a new Svelte project, you can use:

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a Svelte application running locally.

## Conclusion

Svelte offers a fresh approach to building web applications with better performance and developer experience.
